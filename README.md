# University of Ibadan Enrolment Analytics Platform
 
## Business Problem
Universities struggle to predict student enrolment trends, leading to poor resource allocation
(hostels, staff, budgets).

## Objective
To build a data-driven analytics platform that predicts enrolment trends and supports
evidence-based decision-making.

## Data
- 2014–2024 enrolment data
- Academic staff count per faculty
- Hostel space availability
- Graduation outcomes
- GDP growth rate
- Annual Departmental/Faculty budget
- Unemployment rate
- Strike Duration

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Streamlit
- Power BI / Plotly
- GitHub

## Key Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature importance analysis
- Time-series trend analysis
- Machine learning prediction models

## Results & Insights
- Identified enrolment growth patterns by faculty
- Highlighted staff-to-student imbalance risks
- Predicted enrolment trends with X% accuracy

## Business Impact
This solution can help university administrators:
- Plan staffing requirements
- Optimize hostel allocation
- Improve budget forecasting
